**Plant_Disease_Classification**

The dataset is taken from kaggle and the link for the dataset is given:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset] 
This dataset contains three labels, "Healthy", "Powdery", "Rust" referring to plant conditions. There is a total of 1530 images divided into train, test, and validation sets.

The project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques for plant disease classification, aiming to assist farmers and agricultural experts in early disease detection and management. By harnessing the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing algorithms, this system can accurately identify various diseases affecting crops based on images of plant leaves.
The plant disease classification system utilizes a curated dataset and ResNet-34(is a CNN) model with pretrained weights for accurate disease detection. Managed by the Trainer class, training is streamlined for iterative model refinement. Dynamic optimizer selection and scheduler configuration enable tailored training parameters, while integrated logging provides comprehensive insights into training metrics for informed decision-making. This system enhances crop health management for sustainable agriculture.
